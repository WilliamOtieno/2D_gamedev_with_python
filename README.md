I will produce the old classic 2D games in Python such as Pong, Snake Xenzia...etc
In the case of importing os, Linux users should implement the module os.system("aplay bounce.wav&")
Mac users should use os.system("afplay bounce.wav&")
Windows users should import winsound(exists only in windows) and implement the module winsound.PlaySound("bounce.wav", winsound.SND_ASYNC)
You should however make sure the bounce.wav file is in the same directory as pong.py
